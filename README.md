# Reverse-Vending-Machine
A set of application that accepts used (empty) beverage containers and returns points as reward to the user. Unlike normal vending machines where one has to insert money to get the product, RVM functions to collect recyclable beverage containers as part of the greater perspective of solid waste management.
•
RVM, depending on the machine’s configuration, have the ability to accept a range of beverage containers (cans, glass bottles and plastics). RVM generally automates container recycling by accepting containers directly from the consumer, accounting for each container processed, and refunding the deposit to the consumer or by points collection.
